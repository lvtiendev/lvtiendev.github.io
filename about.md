# Hello World!

My name is Le Viet Tien, or Tony if you cannot spell Vietnamese. I am studying Computer Science at <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg">National University of Singapore</a>. I love my major, and particularly Software Engineering. I like to play with new technologies within the tech world and build things upon them. Click <a href="/projects">here</a> to checkout some of the cool stuffs I have built!
