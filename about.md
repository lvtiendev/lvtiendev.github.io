Hello World!
============

My name is Le Viet Tien, or Tony if you cannot spell Vietnamese. I am studying Computer Science at [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg). I love my major, and particularly Software Engineering. I like to play with new technologies within the tech world and build things upon them.
